# Project 02 - Group 03

## Introduction
In the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) mini project, we will embark on an exciting journey to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and various data manipulation techniques. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in data extraction, transformation, and loading processes, which are fundamental in real-world data engineering projects.

Throughout this project, we will collaborate with my team to extract data from thse given sources, transform it into a structured format suitable for analysis, and finally load the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database. We leverage Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, and we have used Python dictionary methods to efficiently extract and transform the data.

As part of the ETL process, we have createed four CSV files containing the transformed data. These CSV files will serve as the basis for creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and designing a table schema for the PostgreSQL database. This project will provide us a comprehensive understanding of the ETL process, from data extraction to database integration, and to gain valuable skills for handling real-world data engineering challenges.
